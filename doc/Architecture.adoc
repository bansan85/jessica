= Architecture

== Library

The whole backend is build in a single library.

The library must be buildable with option `-fvisibility=hidden`. So all symbols that need to be used must be explicitly exported.

For this job, it will be used:

- `\__declspec(dllimport)` and `__declspec(dllexport)` will be used for https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/importing-and-exporting[Windows],
- `\\__attribute__((visibility("default")))` will be used for Linux.

Internally, you must define the macro `BUILDING_JESSICA_DLL`.
